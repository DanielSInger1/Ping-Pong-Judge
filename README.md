<h1>Real-Time Table Tennis Game Analysis</h1>
<p>This project is designed to judge and analyze a game of table tennis in real-time. By utilizing advanced computer vision techniques, the system can track the ball and determine various game events such as bounces and points.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Real-Time Analysis:</strong> The system captures and processes video frames in real-time to provide immediate feedback on game events.</li>
  <li><strong>YOLOv8 Model:</strong> A YOLOv8 model trained specifically for table tennis is used to detect and track the ball with high accuracy.</li>
  <li><strong>Multi-Object Detection:</strong> The model is trained to detect not only the ball but also other relevant objects such as hands, table, net, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>CUDA Acceleration:</strong> The use of CUDA technology ensures fast processing, allowing for seamless real-time performance.</li>
  <li><strong>Game Event Detection:</strong> The system detects key events such as bounces on the table, double bounces, and when the ball hits the floor.</li>
  <li><strong>Player Scoring:</strong> Automatically updates and displays the score based on the detected events.</li>
</ul>
